# Jam-of-the-Week
Independent Project with Prof. Shilad Sen of Macalester College. 

Prior research has studied the relationship between demographics and how people evaluate music performers. This project extends this work to study the relationship between demographics and evaluations of music performance on Facebook in the "Jam of the Week" group. After collecting initial datasets, we infer the gender of performers based on their names, and analyze the relationship between gender and feedback. Such feedback includes number of comments and reactions on the posts.

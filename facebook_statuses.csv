Usually if I don't know a tune someone requests, I follow up with ""I'll add it to the list."" It may come off like I'm writing them off, but I do actually keep a list.  I whittle away at it when I find the time.  It not only helps to keep me employed and accountable; it also turns me on to music I wouldn't have dug otherwise. Most of the time. :)

Anyway, here's the latest I've been working on, ""Brick"" by Ben Folds Five. Admittedly I'm still faking a few parts but, as with most things, it's a work in progress.

C&C always cool!

558429457587216_1244329748997180,#jotw bass doesn't need to solo on this.  One take as bass for a ballad (@60) and then as bass on something up @180.  I change chords a bit in first two measures to give in more of a Cedar Walton harmonic feel (at least in my mind).  Pretty soon AI (artificial intelligence) will be able to compose and improvise in a way that will probably pass a musical Turing Test. If there would be a distinguishing feature it will probably be the human mistakes.

558429457587216_1229845850445570,"I've been torturing my buddy Ben Tweedt with really tough chord changes lately, so I decided what goes around comes around.

I asked him to give me some brutal changes for ""Alone Together"", but in return, I'd try to make it sound half-decent.

Ben tracked keys and keybass, then I beefed his tracks up and added some drum programming and textures.

I haven't tried coming up with a custom soprano FX patch before, so I thought I would cook up two variations. I also tried Apple Loops for the first time, and tried to incorporate a soft metronome into the track just to see if I could do it tastefully.

I attempted to play these changes by ear with 15 minutes of practice (since I've forced him to do worse). This was my second take. The first one went straight into the Trash folder.

I'll probably re-do it and post it online somewhere; we'll see.

Critiques and Commentary welcome!

558429457587216_1220495148047307,"Stochelo Rosenberg in action!
Why settle for less than the very best? 
Django a Gogo is simply the greatest Django festival and music camp ever organized!
Video filmed in Eindhoven,NL by Irene Ypenburg. Featuring the grandmaster of Gypsy Jazz guitar Stochelo Rosenberg, David Gastine and Stephane Wrembel. 
Imagine the whole crew at Carnegie Hall with Al Di Meola, Larry Keel, Nick Driscoll, Thor Jensen, Nick Anderson, Ari Folman-Cohen and Ryan Montbleau!
DJANGO A GOGO 2017 is a Django festival organized by Stephane Wrembel. This might just be the greatest Django festival ever: A whole week filled with teaching, concerts with extraordinary musicians, and jams every night, culminating with a concert on 3/3/17 at the Stern Auditorium at CARNEGIE HALL!
The world-class teaching lineup, the extremely thoughtful organizational nization, and most importantly, the once in a lifetime opportunity to attend the show at Carnegie Hall are what sets this camp apart from the rest.
The all-star lineup of performers and teachers:
- Al Di Meola (USA)
- Stochelo Rosenberg (Holland)
- Stephane Wrembel(USA/France)
- Paulus Schafer (Holland)
- Larry Keel (USA)
- Denis Chang (Canada)
- Alfonso Ponticelli (USA)
- David Gastine (France)
- Juanito Pascual (USA)
- Olli Soikkeli (USA/Finland)
- Thor Jensen (USA)
- Sara L'Abriola (USA)
Structure and organization of the festival:
Besides the show at Carnegie Hall, most of the events (teaching, concerts, and jam sessions) will take place at The Woodland (Maplewood NJ), and Barbes (Brooklyn NY).
The music camp is open to everyone; all instruments, all ages, all levels. From beginners to professionals, everyone will get what they need. Stephane Wrembel has been teaching, organizing workshops, and has been a part of many guitar camps, university programs and festivals worldwide for the past 25 years. All these years of experience allowed him to design a music camp with a perfect balance between professionalism and fun.
Each of the all-star teachers has a unique way of teaching; providing different angles and tricks to their students. All participants will have the opportunity to work with every teacher in a small group setting. These groups will be organized according to individual ability levels, and will be provided with perfectly crafted instruction based upon the group members' needs.
The two morning sessions will be dedicated to small groups. One focusing on rhythm and accompaniment, the second focusing on improvisation techniques. The teachers will deliver serious, focused instruction with a fun and laid back approach. The afternoon sessions will be comprised of whole group classes and workshops based on various specialized subjects. Some of these include Django solo transcriptions and analysis, and specialty improvisation techniques (Stochelo Rosenberg, Al Di Meola, Larry Keel, Juanito Pascual).
While not jamming and participating in workshops and classes, participants will have the opportunity to enjoy the bustling downtown of Maplewood, NJ (just across from NYC, 20mn from the Holland tunnel, 30mn by train to Penn station, 10mn from Newark airport). There are a variety of restaurants and pubs, boutique shopping, and great coffee and pastries from the best bakery in town, all within one block of the venue!
There are hotel deals within a 10mn radius (deals listed on the website), and an army of drivers and vans to transport students to and from the venue!
Stephane and his crew will take great care of you! You will have nothing to do but enjoy amazing teaching from the best players and teachers in the world, and concerts and jam sessions every evening. All of this located in a lively town, loaded with music lovers and artists. Don't hesitate, register now! It is a once in a lifetime event, do not miss it!

As far as my practice routine, I'd say it varies from day to day depending what I need to be doing. Lately I'm working more on my reading skills. This video is all improvised. I do improvised practice etudes of various durations every day as I feel first and foremost that as an improvising musician, this needs constant practice to be able to improvise on anything anytime.

Had an embouchure problem last year from severe muscle fatigue that basically made me rethink my entire approach to the horn. What I've come to now is basically a combination of embouchure adjustments (puckering my lips more in the low range and in general extending my jaw to make my teeth alignment more even) and playing lines that work with my strengths instead of against them.  All of the things I play flow and slot very well for my chops. If I tried to play anything else besides my own personal concept it would probably not go so well. Long story short, this was an intense practice session and my chops were ground up hambruger by this point. As long as Im counter acting with my embouchure adjustments and playing my own harmonic concepts that flow well off my horn, then it will always work. 
(Just to clarify when I say ""my own personal concepts"" I am actually referring to a system of atonal harmony that I have created for my own playing after a lot of years experimenting) Trust me however good it sounds now, it took a lot of shitty playing on my part to get there!

1.24705E+15,558429457587216_1246259708804184,1.247E+15,"Hey man! Here is the explanation I gave Kennedy Powers a few weeks when he asked me the same thing on one of my other vids. I hope this helps!

""As for the shapes, its really a form of what I call chromatic sequencing. I take a cell that spans a certain range, come up with a line within that cell, and then shift up in half steps, each time trying to come up with a different melodic shape for each cell. This can be done with a multitutde of different intervals, for example tritones ... C-F#,F-C#-D-G#.... Major or minor thirds C-E,F-A,Bb-D,Eb-G .... C-Eb,E-G etc.... 4ths F-Bb , B-E , F-Bb. This can also be done with differing intervals, for example it doesn't always have to be in a patterns of major 3rds, 4ths, tritones etc... each cell can have a unique interval range that it takes ie C-E,F-Bb-B-F... the idea is that they are always displaced by a half step. The idea is to really come up with a unique shape in each cell which can also mean hovering around the notes within that range for more than one complete rotation or choosing to move on. By choosing to either mimic the interval range of your previous cell , or expand/collapse upon that , you can generate non linear chromatic lines that either grow in range, shrink in range, or hover around the same range each time you shift.

1.24503E+15,558429457587216_1240853076011514,,"Nice playing. The most important element of solo guitar is time. Your playing is beautiful because the swing is always there, even when you're silent. A lot of guitar players don't realize that they can keep swinging even in between chords, so they feel they have to mark every beat and they end up stumbling because on guitar it's just not possible to simulate a whole band the entire time. But you've got a wonderful groove going that doesn't depend on the notes you play, so that allows you to play as much or as little as you want without losing the music. From that place there is no limit to what you can do. I look forward to hearing more of your music! Gorgeous vamp at the end too. :-)",David Reed,2/2/2017 23:27,1

1.2284E+15,558429457587216_1228274750602680,1.22838E+15,"Hi Mike! Honestly, I'm not really using either economy or alternate picking here. 
The subject of ""picking"" is, of course, part of the larger question of articulation, which is a fascinating subject. 

When I started playing jazz, I noticed that across all instruments, there was a sort of consensus around jazz articulation, and how to play eighth notes. There seemed to be a standard, or an ideal, that all the great improvisers had in common, across all instruments. 

The one exception to this - and to my distress, at the time - was ""jazz guitar"". I noticed that a lot of jazz guitarists seemed to have an articulation that was the result of strict alternate picking, or at least picking almost every note. To my ear, this resulted in eighth-note lines that were not up to the standard of articulation that I was hearing from sax players and piano players. This really bothered me. 

Then I heard John Scofield, who was the first guitarist I heard who played eighth notes that felt as good as Joe Henderson , Sonny Rollins, Bill Evans, or Clifford Brown. It was a revelation for me, and I studied his playing closely and tried to do what he was doing. 

So now, what works for me is to only pick maybe 50% of notes (a very rough approximation). If I'm going to a new string, I have to pick the first note on that string. But I do a lot of hammering and pulling, which helps me get the time feel I want. 

All I'm trying to do is measure up to what I see as a universal ideal of articulation among jazz musicians. Though there is some variation in how the jazz greats play eighth notes, I think there's more in common than there is different. For me, Scofield is the guy who has cracked the code of this articulation as applied to the guitar, so that's how I've tried to approach things. 

Hope that's helpful! Thanks for listening. 👍",Paul Pieper,1/19/2017 15:23,44

Some C&C if you care to take it: Your ideas are super hip, but I would recommend trying new rhythmic emphasis though, like starting and idea on 4.  As bass players, we all have a tendency to wait for the chord on 1 before we outline our melodies, and practicing different places to begin your phrases will really open up your playing.

From there I plug it right into the interface and add some compression and a light spreader in Logic. The video is filmed with a simple HD-Camcorder and then synced with the audio I recorded in Logic. I u Final Cut Pro, but most video editing softwares should be able to do that.

The thing I would recommend for your playing would be more of an intervallic sensibility. One way of doing this would be coming up with a chromatic shape and sequencing it up by a combination of whole steps and half steps, or an interval of your choosing. Its the same type of concept as playing poly pentatonics transposed through a few different keys , except instead of a pentatonic scale you have an actual melodic gesture.

This idea really stems FROM brass players though and our manipulation of the partial system. Woody, Freddie and Booker were masters at this type of chromatic sequencing. If anything I think it actually generates interest in listeners because at that point they are listening for the shapes of the lines you are playing rather than just if you play this note over that chord. Just my two cents, its definitely something that needs to be done through trial and error ... I can totally agree with that. It also has to do with personal preference and what shapes and contours you feel connect best with your own personal sensibility.",Max Acree,1/18/2017 16:00,1

But, if you can't grow your real nails or having trouble, I do from time to time use the fake glue-on nails you can find a CVS or Walgreens. I am not a fan of acrylic nails, one it ruins your nail-bed. I can't stand the way it sounds, they click on the strings, especially the  treble strings.

Trad jazz holds influence from ragtime, which means that arpeggiations. Try to experiment with arpeggios and melodic mixture.

Also, don't be afraid to syncopate lines, have some fun with the rhythm while still swinging! Start messing around with Blues and pentatonic licks, it's completely  fine to play that stuff in trad jazz! 

Keep at it, your enthusiasm is infectious. Go listen to as much trad jazz as you can and start emulating.",Jon Kratzer,1/13/2017 02:35,1

There can be a risk of using ""out"" concepts/playing to be exclusive and other more negative derivatives of exclusivity at the risk of letting ego get in the way of sincerity/honesty, unfortunately.

None of these musical ideas really take in the chords or underlying harmonic structure into consideration, then again I wouldn't really consider myself a ""jazz improviser"" just more of an improviser. The things Im drawing from are  derived massively from a 20th century classical sensibility among other things. Really when it comes down to it,  I sequence chromatic and intervallic cells in differing shapes to generate interest.

1.21761E+15,558429457587216_1217207615042727,1.2176E+15,"My doodle was never very strong and I always had trouble tonguing with it across the partials, so no. Mostly everything is just single with a lot of slurs. If its ridiculously fast, say over  320 bpm I usually employ a soft double using reverse syllables ie ... gah-duh-gah-duh-gah . 

As for the shapes, its really a form of what I call chromatic sequencing. I take a cell that spans a certain range, come up with a line within that cell, and then shift up in half steps, each time trying to come up with a different melodic shape for each cell. This can be done with a multitutde of different intervals, for example tritones ... C-F#,F-C#-D-G#.... Major or minor thirds C-E,F-A,Bb-D,Eb-G .... C-Eb,E-G etc.... 4ths F-Bb , B-E , F-Bb. This can also be done with differing intervals, for example it doesn't always have to be in a patterns of major 3rds, 4ths, tritones etc... each cell can have a unique interval range that it takes ie C-E,F-Bb-B-F... the idea is that they are always displaced by a half step. The idea is to really come up with a unique shape in each cell which can also mean hovering around the notes within that range for more than one complete rotation or choosing to move on. By choosing to either mimic the interval range of your previous cell , or expand/collapse upon that , you can generate non linear chromatic lines that either grow in range, shrink in range, or hover around the same range each time you shift. 

I know this is a super long and windy explanation and at first it can seem kind of non sensical, because it is personalized for my own style.",Max Acree,1/8/2017 01:14,2

The way you explain your playing reminds me of the trombone, played with physical explosions of miniature movements, like fretting on a guitar with air driven partials instead of differently tuned strings, and a peculiar set of length parameters that mimic the non-fretted string family, but play out like a kazoo (you really only get out of it what you put in)  Wow, exemplary playing, nice to hear new language spoken on the bone.

"Joey, I know you've dug deep with his stuff.  Asking for critique here...I know you've got something valuable.","Thanks Jeff, it's gets even better when played loud as the sound is recirculated beck into the instrument.","That's a great idea! I'm gonna work that on piano...","'Sgood. Do triplets too. And on tunes. Slower tunes you can do sixteenths and sextuplets.","You could have jammed some whole tone","Paul Pieper I feel you. Idk just saying you could have played out a few times and milked a few more seconds. Beautiful as always tho","kurt rosenwinkle says whole tone is just a sound don't worry about it. ill talk his word for it. lol","Learn, recognize, then forget.","Zakk Jones fosho! You gotta learn the shit before you can break it","It's kind of like the book ""Superchops"" by Howard Roberts: straight 1/8's pick every note (repeated notes are ok), but find the tempo you're comfortable doing it for 5 or 10 min straight at, then slowly go up in tempo. I can maybe hang at 120 for a couple minutes! :-)","I find this helps me ""get out of my own way"", somewhat. For me, improv is mostly about getting into the right frame of mind. When you just have to keep playing, you have to relax and not be tense. It's certainly interesting.","Everyone in the whole group should have to transcribe this. All I could think was how much good it would do me if I transcribed while I listened!!","Have you seen the book jazz guitar technique in 20 weeks by Howard Roberts? I've done it a few times and got quite ok at this via that book. Was useful. Must revisit.","Thanks Hunter! I like the many possibilities for motifs with this tune.","I am working on audience development - Syracuse doesn't really have much of a listening crowd. Any tips?","Lovely. Ralph is just...something, ain't he?

I like the choice of fingerstyle playing on the gypsy guitar, too. They're really nice for that.","Work on your tone without any effects at first. Try to play more legato.","Thank you so much man, it's an interesting suggestion! I really appreciate your help ðŸ™‚","Sounds really nice. I'd agree with Andres, if you really want to work on expression and tone, work on the stuff that comes from the fingers themselves.

It's why I think (but I'm nobody, of course) every guitar player should spend some time with a nylon string instrument.","It's an interesting point! You're probably right and I'm going to work on my classical guitar ðŸ™‚ thank you so much for your suggestions ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚","Armando, bass amps typically have a flatter EQ ""voice"" than guitar amps which are mostly engineered for rock music. This is just an inexpensive practice amp with the convenience of battery power for outdoor playing, but my regular rig is Acoustic Image, also founded as bass amp makers. For guitar they added reverb which is very nice.","Thanks for the info"

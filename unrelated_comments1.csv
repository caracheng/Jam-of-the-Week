"Man I wish I had enough money to buy all those instruments... also would love to have time to master them all as well","Nice stuff! Too bad you can't do it live!!","Don't tell me you mixed it all :))))","Wow! what a big project!","Cheers Sam, YouTube.com/simonpeterking [[SHARE]]","Peter Eratostene Steven Resendes yaaaaa","Did you buy the chart then play the parts?","Yes","Adam Hebditch","Charlie Osborn wut","Told you he was a beast Roz!","Yes you did, and rightly so!","What instrument is Dave playing in his solo? Very nice, kinda Bennie Maupin sound.","Jose Rua lembra dessa?","Class stuff. What program do you use for the split screen. Really cool.","TrakAx PC","Im not sure they still exist actually, I just hope the program keeps working as I don't know how to use any other!  Haha","Bob writes some cool stuff...","Zach Bornheimer","Philip Munther","Dilshan Weerasinghe","Yes Mark (y) in this style and on nylon acoustic guitar Towner is the number 1 for me; and he is a great piano player too","Thanks!","Thanks very much!","Rocco Scarcella","Thanks very much!","Thanks for the comment! Yeah, it's a G#... ish... It's clearly a major chord with the G# as the melody note but the way DF sings it it's a bit bluesy-ish at that spot. Actually, in all three choruses he does not sing it the same way each time. When you arrange a vocal melody for an instrument sometimes things won't match up perfectly, especially a fretted instrument, let a lone a piano, so sometimes you have to decide this note or that. In this case I thought the G# is the most representative, if not quite 100% accurate...","Looking at your booze stash, you could hold cocktail parties as well as play for them!!","Forget it, I aint playing for free at my own parties! :-)","What strings are you using Jake? They always sound so clear","Aimee, thanks so much, really interesting comment, you are not the first, see what I wrote to someone just above: Thanks for the comment! Yeah, it's a G#... ish...

That's what I love.","Aimee Nolte well... Post  a version? Would love to hear! I do this with Taylor Roberts sometimes, we call this a tune challenge. Currently I owe him a tune by Seal. He owes me $1 million...","Jake Reichbart I'm a Jazz guitarist.  That's pocket change.","Thanks!","Jake Byrd","Kidding. KIDDING!!","[[STICKER]]","I said KIDDING!","😎","Taylor Roberts [[STICKER]]","Thanks!  I'd totally sing, but would rather keep my friends/gigs/family/JOTW membership... :)","Thanks man!","Your comment...  :)","Don't know where it went.. My internet has been very temperamental today. It said ""C&C's welcome.""","You play this when your neighbors are banging and you might convert them to jazz fans!:)","Haha! I doubt it unfortunately Mark.

I love your tone! May I ask you something? 1) How do you organize your practice routine? Did you improvise in the video? 3) Where did you buy your  t-shirt? :)","Thanks Victor, this tone machine is by Tom Ribbecke (who I'm happy to plug at every opportunity).  As far as my practice routine, I'd say it varies from day to day depending what I need to be doing. Lately I'm working more on my reading skills. This video is all improvised. I do improvised practice etudes of various durations every day as I feel first and foremost that as an improvising musician, this needs constant practice to be able to improvise on anything anytime. Now the shirt.....:)","With all due respect to Ribbecke, I'm pretty sure you're the tone machine. The guitar helps. :-)","Jonathan, no I suck without it- really.","Mark Kleinhaut lol... right!  :-)","Thanks Aimee. The ""N"" is for noodles:)","Thanks K!","Thanks Jurgen","Thanks Greg:)","Thx dear","Haha thx Scott","Really thanks Mark","Thank you 😊","is it you that posted a version of my one & only love few weeks ago?

"" 요즘 연습하고 있는 즉흥연주 도전입니다. 메트로놈을 최하 200bpm 부터 시작합니다. 끊이지않는 지속적인 8분음표(오직)를 1-6-2-5 코드진행(각코드당 1마디)에서 연주합니다. 어떤 음일탈이나 중단은 연주를 멈추고 다시 시작해야함을 의미합니다. 연속적인 8분음표라인은 코드진행에 철저히 부합해야하며 논센스에 빠지지 말아야하고 또한 너무 잦은 아이디어의 반복을 금해야합니다."" 오늘의 최선은 1분20초 지만 언젠가 5분을 목표로 합니다.","Wow!
고맙습니다!","Gonna make my students do it too","That's exactl what I'm working on recently as well except at 120 Bpm.","Don Russo it's like guitar crossfit hahah","I'm no good at ""using scales"" in a solo. I don't think I ever play anything that's whole-tone related, though. :-)","Scales suck!","Honestly, scales do suck. As a way of thinking about improv, i can't help but feel like they're a fairly recent invention.","Paul Pieper yeah just people trying to justify what they are hearing. I do think it helps with identifying things you are hearing tho.","Paul Pieper AMEN","Daaaamn Paul, here we go again to the lick stealing","U ok man?😂","Diego Rafael Ureña Santana","Michael Fotopoulos Louis Bergemann face = shred","Sammy Gessesse Joey Parker","Phil Brouillette François Nadeau","Ouais cest un malade ce gars là il post a chaque semaines et cest une turie à chaque fois","Thats my goal ! 1625, 30 ans !","Yep, that's the subtitle of Superchops.

I actually have an old copy. I scuffled through it a couple of times using just key centers, once in 1979 when I was 17, and again in 1981 or 82 at GIT. I probably should revisit it as an adult! ;-) [[PHOTO]]","Hi Nick Granville can you send me the PDF please? I couldn´t find it on the net.","Jorge Aguilar I'm away for a while in the states, but I just did a google search and it's on this site so that might be quicker than when I could send it to you. https://www.scribd.com/doc/255714747/Jazz-guitar-technique-in-20-weeks-howard-roberts-pdf [[SHARE]]","If you can't get it message me in a week, I'll be home by then.

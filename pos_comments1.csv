"Great!  I especially like the bass clarinet solo.","Brilliant!","Holy crap.","That was awesome! Is there anywhere I can listen to more of your music? I always dig your playing on here and the productions you make with all the different instruments. Cheers man","They should put a smile emoji because that's what this just made me do.","brilliance","booom!","Daaang this sounds GREAT!","Hot. Damn.

Hot Fiyahh.","Amaazziinngg!","I mean come on. That's too freaking good.","Holy crap!","Yo, awesome! Well done both.","This is so sick man! Big well done to both of you! One of the things I find amazing about this group (and musicianship in general) is that we all naturally pull towards creativity as a means of entertaining ourselves, as apposed to wasting time on meaningless endeavours and projects! I think this is something that you both highlight here.. just the pure fulfilment of making music. It's amazing, and I highly respect your proactivity and creativity. Well done!!","Nice!","Awesome!","Wahhhooo","wtf get the fuck out of here

This is sick","Well done chaps, i don't think im ever gonna bother again 😭","Wow man !","Hip as fuck","Amazing :)","fuckin groooooooooooves ~ sounds amazing, man!","Very inspiring!","Beyond amazing","That was marvelous.  It seems very fe people are hip to Ralph Towner and his incredible approach that mixes classical and jazz.","excellent - you've really captured the RT vibe!","love it","Very very nice!!","Yo mark!!","Fabulous!!!","That sounded great!","That is a LOT of music on 6 strings! It really is a faithful rendering. (I don't play this song but I thought the very last note of the chorus [""when you get >HOME<) was 1/2 step lower than that.....]","I love this. I can hear the words as you play the song. That's so important. Also, you and I have a different idea of what the melody is. It's hard to tell on these Dan songs because the harmonies are so tight and every note seems as important as the other one. Also, you decided to play the major third on ""when you get HOME"" and I always sing the minor. So interesting and awesome to hear!","Also, I wasn't just talking about that note. I was talking about a good chunk of the chorus. You played something different than I would've played for them whole melody. I love that.","One of my favorite tunes ever. You've done a marvelous job on this one, man.","Thanks very much!","Very good My frends","You'll make me a devout SD fan yet!!  Been spinning your latest quite a bit man.

Great stuff Jake.","I swear, I thought were going to bust out singing:) sounds good bro.","You're really making a pretty boring song interesting with the fullness of your approach.","Lovin' the feeling, as always : )","Reminding me of Joe Henderson at :44.

Congratulations","Great song and you're getting nice chordal colors.","Fluid, Paul!","Wow","This is absolutely outrageous...my bop chops aren't good enough to have licks like that period. Incredible video, seriously!","sounds are the way to go 👍🏼","Very impressive","This is great.  I haven't done this in a while and have definitely never timed myself!

Fantastic playing man!","Wow!!  Fantastic man.  Cheers.","Nice playing and repping the ESL T. :D","I really liked how cleanly you played the transcription, but duuuude I loved how you took Coltrane's phrasing and let it run free in your own voice (I'm not a big uke fan..until someone plays it like that).

I don't tend to use delay as part of my ""jazz"" sound but it seems like what many people do nowadays.

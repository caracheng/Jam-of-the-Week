It really is a faithful rendering. (I don't play this song but I thought the very last note of the chorus [""when you get >HOME<) was 1/2 step lower than that.....]","Thanks for the comment! Yeah, it's a G#... ish... It's clearly a major chord with the G# as the melody note but the way DF sings it it's a bit bluesy-ish at that spot. Actually, in all three choruses he does not sing it the same way each time. When you arrange a vocal melody for an instrument sometimes things won't match up perfectly, especially a fretted instrument, let a lone a piano, so sometimes you have to decide this note or that. In this case I thought the G# is the most representative, if not quite 100% accurate...","Looking at your booze stash, you could hold cocktail parties as well as play for them!!","Forget it, I aint playing for free at my own parties! :-)","What strings are you using Jake? They always sound so clear","Aimee, thanks so much, really interesting comment, you are not the first, see what I wrote to someone just above: Thanks for the comment! Yeah, it's a G#... ish...

I do this with Taylor Roberts sometimes, we call this a tune challenge. Currently I owe him a tune by Seal. He owes me $1 million...","Jake Reichbart I'm a Jazz guitarist.

I'd totally sing, but would rather keep my friends/gigs/family/JOTW membership... :)","Joey, I know you've dug deep with his stuff.  Asking for critique here...I know you've got something valuable.","Thanks man!","Don't know where it went.. My internet has been very temperamental today. It said ""C&C's welcome.""","You play this when your neighbors are banging and you might convert them to jazz fans!:)","Haha! I doubt it unfortunately Mark. They're miserable buggers.","Dean Newton - I meant when they're ""banging"":)","Me too ;-) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buggery [[SHARE]]","Oh, and pleSe comment:)","Thanks Roger!","Thanks Victor, this tone machine is by Tom Ribbecke (who I'm happy to plug at every opportunity).  As far as my practice routine, I'd say it varies from day to day depending what I need to be doing. Lately I'm working more on my reading skills. This video is all improvised. I do improvised practice etudes of various durations every day as I feel first and foremost that as an improvising musician, this needs constant practice to be able to improvise on anything anytime. Now the shirt.....:)","With all due respect to Ribbecke, I'm pretty sure you're the tone machine. The guitar helps. :-)","Jonathan, no I suck without it- really.","Thanks Aimee. The ""N"" is for noodles:)","Thanks K!","Thanks Jurgen","Thanks Greg:)","Thanks Jeff, it's gets even better when played loud as the sound is recirculated beck into the instrument.","Thx dear","Haha thx Scott","Really thanks Mark","Thank you 😊","is it you that posted a version of my one & only love few weeks ago?

Do triplets too. And on tunes. Slower tunes you can do sixteenths and sextuplets.","Don Russo it's like guitar crossfit hahah","You could have jammed some whole tone","I'm no good at ""using scales"" in a solo. I don't think I ever play anything that's whole-tone related, though. :-)","Scales suck!","kurt rosenwinkle says whole tone is just a sound don't worry about it. ill talk his word for it. lol","Honestly, scales do suck. As a way of thinking about improv, i can't help but feel like they're a fairly recent invention.","Paul Pieper yeah just people trying to justify what they are hearing. I do think it helps with identifying things you are hearing tho.","Learn, recognize, then forget.","Zakk Jones fosho! You gotta learn the shit before you can break it","Paul Pieper AMEN","I find this helps me ""get out of my own way"", somewhat. For me, improv is mostly about getting into the right frame of mind. When you just have to keep playing, you have to relax and not be tense. It's certainly interesting.","Daaaamn Paul, here we go again to the lick stealing","U ok man?😂","Diego Rafael Ureña Santana","Everyone in the whole group should have to transcribe this.

The Howard Roberts is out of print, if you want a copy let me know, I can send you a link to the PDF  - I don't feel bad doing that cause how else can one get a copy...","Nick, thanks! I actually have an old copy. I scuffled through it a couple of times using just key centers, once in 1979 when I was 17, and again in 1981 or 82 at GIT. I probably should revisit it as an adult! ;-) [[PHOTO]]","Hi Nick Granville can you send me the PDF please?

Ralph is just...something, ain't he?

I like the choice of fingerstyle playing on the gypsy guitar, too. They're really nice for that.","thanks a lot Jeff - the guitar is a bit of a rare beast, gypsy with nylon strings, with a really comfortable neck","I actually was just about to ask about that!  I was listening an thought ""is that really nylon?""","thank you Evgeny!","Can it be a head to a tune I'm writing?","Looks to me like anything goes!","Yes","But this isnt burger king :p","I should of taken a picture of a whopper lol","Work on your tone without any effects at first. Try to play more legato.","Thank you so much man, it's an interesting suggestion! I really appreciate your help 🙂","Sounds really nice. I'd agree with Andres, if you really want to work on expression and tone, work on the stuff that comes from the fingers themselves.

It's why I think (but I'm nobody, of course) every guitar player should spend some time with a nylon string instrument.","It's an interesting point! You're probably right and I'm going to work on my classical guitar 🙂 thank you so much for your suggestions 🙂🙂🙂","""I don't mind the grey skies, cause they're just...clouds passing by"".","The lyrics in this one really resonate today.","Thanks Simon","Thanks Scott, I always loved that album","Thanks Steve, I just try to play from the feeling and sound of things.","Thanks Oren","Hi Chris, this tune brings it out for sure:) how do you like this new guitar's sound?","chris, my youtube channel has the archive of all for easy A/B comparison.  Your thoughts would be very appreciated. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUIRugzCPnMxf5FT2o6wRw [[SHARE]]","Thanks Shan","These are sad and serious times.","I don't mind:) really, I don't!","Jeff, I never played this tune till this morning, but the lyrics grabbed me and Duke's music is so familiar that it only took a minute.","Thanks Dave, sometimes I do. I love the mellow sound of it, though I don't have much dexterity playing that way. My mentor years back (Ted Dunbar) only played with his thumb.","You going through an amp Mark?","Yes, this one: https://www.roland.com/us/products/micro_cube_bass_rx/ [[SHARE]]","A bass amp! Certainly puts out a nice tone Mark. Can I ask why you chose a bass amp?","Armando, bass amps typically have a flatter EQ ""voice"" than guitar amps which are mostly engineered for rock music. This is just an inexpensive practice amp with the convenience of battery power for outdoor playing, but my regular rig is Acoustic Image, also founded as bass amp makers. For guitar they added reverb which is very nice.","Thanks for the info","Which Acoustic Image head did you buy?  Or was it a combo?","Chris Morrison   I use the AI ""Clarus SLR"" with a pair of Raezers NY8 cabs.  SLR stands for Super Light Reverb, by the way.","I've played through an earlier version of the Clarus head with the Raezer's Edge 2x8 cab.  Loved it.","Cameron Carbrey","Thanks!","Thanks Robert, even though I only played this song for the first time now, I've heard many versions over the years. This is a great thing about this group- challenges us to continuously add to our repertoire.  I'll certainly do this one in my next solo gig:)"

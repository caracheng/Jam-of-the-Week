"Great!  I especially like the bass clarinet solo.","Brilliant!","Nice stuff! Too bad you can't do it live!!","Wow! what a big project!","Holy crap.","That was awesome! Is there anywhere I can listen to more of your music? I always dig your playing on here and the productions you make with all the different instruments. Cheers man","They should put a smile emoji because that's what this just made me do.","brilliance","booom!","Daaang this sounds GREAT!","Hot. Damn.

Hot Fiyahh.","Amaazziinngg!","I mean come on. That's too freaking good.","Holy crap!","Yo, awesome! Well done both.","Told you he was a beast Roz!","What instrument is Dave playing in his solo? Very nice, kinda Bennie Maupin sound.","This is so sick man! Big well done to both of you! One of the things I find amazing about this group (and musicianship in general) is that we all naturally pull towards creativity as a means of entertaining ourselves, as apposed to wasting time on meaningless endeavours and projects! I think this is something that you both highlight here.. just the pure fulfilment of making music. It's amazing, and I highly respect your proactivity and creativity. Well done!!","Nice!","Awesome!","Wahhhooo","wtf get the fuck out of here

This is sick","Well done chaps, i don't think im ever gonna bother again 😭","Wow man !","Hip as fuck","Amazing :)","fuckin groooooooooooves ~ sounds amazing, man!","Very inspiring!","Beyond amazing","That was marvelous.  It seems very fe people are hip to Ralph Towner and his incredible approach that mixes classical and jazz.","excellent - you've really captured the RT vibe!","love it","Very very nice!!","Yo mark!!","Fabulous!!!","Thanks very much!","That sounded great!","I love this. I can hear the words as you play the song. That's so important. Also, you and I have a different idea of what the melody is. It's hard to tell on these Dan songs because the harmonies are so tight and every note seems as important as the other one. Also, you decided to play the major third on ""when you get HOME"" and I always sing the minor. So interesting and awesome to hear!","Jake Reichbart that's really cool. Yeah I totally get it. It doesn't even matter if it's accurate. That's what I love.","Also, I wasn't just talking about that note. I was talking about a good chunk of the chorus. You played something different than I would've played for them whole melody. I love that.","One of my favorite tunes ever. You've done a marvelous job on this one, man.","Very good My frends","You'll make me a devout SD fan yet!!  Been spinning your latest quite a bit man.  Everything sounds so rich and full without being too dense or intricate just for the sake of it.  Great stuff Jake.","I swear, I thought were going to bust out singing:) sounds good bro.","You're really making a pretty boring song interesting with the fullness of your approach.","Your comment...  :)","Lovin' the feeling, as always : )","Mark!  I love your tone! May I ask you something? 1) How do you organize your practice routine? Did you improvise in the video? 3) Where did you buy your  t-shirt? :)","Reminding me of Joe Henderson at :44. Great stuff. 😍","so nice!","👍👍👍","That's really nice Mark....","Lovely, so musical. And the upper register on this guitar really sings.","Sounds great...!","Master of bebop!","Love the relaxed evenness of your 1/8th notes.","Love it man....as always great phrasing .. Congratulations","Great song and you're getting nice chordal colors.","Great... guitar face.","fuaaaa, magical study, very nice Paul","Fluid, Paul!","Wow","Great shed idea, so I shared and translated the script into Korean. 내용이 너무 좋아서 간단하게 번역해봤습니다. "" 요즘 연습하고 있는 즉흥연주 도전입니다. 메트로놈을 최하 200bpm 부터 시작합니다. 끊이지않는 지속적인 8분음표(오직)를 1-6-2-5 코드진행(각코드당 1마디)에서 연주합니다. 어떤 음일탈이나 중단은 연주를 멈추고 다시 시작해야함을 의미합니다. 연속적인 8분음표라인은 코드진행에 철저히 부합해야하며 논센스에 빠지지 말아야하고 또한 너무 잦은 아이디어의 반복을 금해야합니다."" 오늘의 최선은 1분20초 지만 언젠가 5분을 목표로 합니다.","Wow!
고맙습니다!","That's a great idea! I'm gonna work that on piano...","This is absolutely outrageous...my bop chops aren't good enough to have licks like that period. Incredible video, seriously!","Paul Pieper I feel you. Idk just saying you could have played out a few times and milked a few more seconds. Beautiful as always tho","sounds are the way to go 👍🏼","Very impressive","It's kind of like the book ""Superchops"" by Howard Roberts: straight 1/8's pick every note (repeated notes are ok), but find the tempo you're comfortable doing it for 5 or 10 min straight at, then slowly go up in tempo. I can maybe hang at 120 for a couple minutes! :-)","This is great.  I haven't done this in a while and have definitely never timed myself!  Thanks for the inspiration as always Paul.","This is tight","agreed","Wow. Thats awesome. :)","Jorge Aguilar I'm away for a while in the states, but I just did a google search and it's on this site so that might be quicker than when I could send it to you. https://www.scribd.com/doc/255714747/Jazz-guitar-technique-in-20-weeks-howard-roberts-pdf [[SHARE]]","Great WORK out for any instrument.","This is amazing!","You da man Paul!","Noyce","Alright alright alright 👌","Killingggg!!!!!!","👏👏👏👏","Girl buuurnin it up","Sounding dope dude","Yes Nicole!!!! 🎼🎼🎼🎼","Muito bom !!!!

Fantastic playing man!","Wow!!  Fantastic man.  Cheers.","Nice playing and repping the ESL T. :D","I really liked how cleanly you played the transcription, but duuuude I loved how you took Coltrane's phrasing and let it run free in your own voice (I'm not a big uke fan..until someone plays it like that). Really enjoyed the solo this week!","Sweet!","That's awesome!","Awesome!","Nice tune. Can tell you ""feel it.""","nice melody! would be nice to hear this one in time too","YeS!

What are your reverb/delay settings.  Are you using any tone prints?  I don't tend to use delay as part of my ""jazz"" sound but it seems like what many people do nowadays.
